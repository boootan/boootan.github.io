# Sonny Tan's Portfolio
Hi! Welcome to my portfolio, this README will serve as an index for my projects, with a short description of the folder. Another README will be included in the folder for each section, with a description of the projects.

For inquires, please contact sonnytbusiness@gmail.com

# API Development
This section is an example of a real production API that I developed for an application professionally.

# SQL Database
This section contains the SQL source files for a relational database that simulates one that would be used in a Doctor's Office. This was created in CPSC 332 at California State University, Fullerton by Sonny Tan and Chaney Chantipaporn

# KnightHorse Game
This is a fully featured video game built with Unreal Engine that was networked with an API that I built with help from my team members. We were able to push/pull scores of different users using the endpoints we created.

# Algorithms
This section contains algorithms that were created in CPSC 335 and optimized for runtime efficiency. I included these to demonstrate my knowledge of Python, data structures, and algorithm engineering.
